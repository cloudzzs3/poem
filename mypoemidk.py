In twilight's hush, where shadows dance and play,
A lonely ape, with sorrow in his eyes,
Fell down a tree, with a heavy heart and sway,
His dreams of bananas, now but a distant sigh.

His once-proud form, now bruised and battered,
Lies on the forest floor, his spirit shattered,
The laughter of the trees, now turned to mock,
As he, a fallen king, his fate unlocked.

His arms, once strong, now limp and weak,
His knees, once bent, now stiff and seize,
His eyes, once bright, now dim and meek,
His heart, once full, now empty and sleek.

The wind whispers secrets, of a time long past,
When he, a hero, ruled the forest vast,
But now, he lies, a broken shell,
A shadow of his former self, a fallen spell.

The stars above, they twinkle and wink,
As if to say, "We still believe in you, dear ape, you link."
But he, so lost, so lost in his despair,
Can only weep, and wish for repair.
